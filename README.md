# GameBrowser Images

This repository is a store for all the images referenced within the web project.

The intention is that the API will be able to return an image URL (or array of URLs) in any server response.

This will also have the added benefit of removing the images from the code projects so they're more lightweight for cloning etc.

## DISCLAIMER
All images are copyright of their respective owners.
